# Memory-Game
A memory game. Match all 8 pairs of cards to win. This game was built part of the Udacity Front End Developer Course.

## Instructions on playing the game
* There are 8 pairs of cards placed face down on the game board.
* Tap on a second card and if the cards match the cards will stay face up otherwise they will flip back over. This counts as one move. 
* Match all pairs to win the game.
* The clock is running during game play and the faster you complete the game the higher your score will be. 
* At the beginning of the game your score will start at 1000 and for every second that passes a point will be deducted from 1000.
* Players who achieve a high score will be rewarded by being placed on the leaderboard. There is only enough room for the five best scores. 

## Instructions to run game
* Open the 'dist/index.html' in your web browser

## Instructions to run game using npm
* Requires NPM. Details can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
* Open your command prompt or terminal and run 'npm install' to download all of the dependencies.
* Type 'npm start' from the command line or terminal to start the game. This will open a new page in your browser.

## Navigating the code base
I have tried to follow the MVC model to the best of my current understanding.
* Models can be found in /js/models
* Views can be found in /js/views
* The controller can be found in /js/app.js

Sorry for not documenting more! This game is due today and I have run out of time :( I will endeavour to update this and also refactor after submission.
